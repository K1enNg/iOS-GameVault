# GameVault

## Overview

Many gamers struggle to keep track of their game collection, which most likely keeps growing. Whether it’s physical or digital, it’s easy to lose track of what’s in your library. Our app aims to solve this problem by providing a simple and efficient way to catalog and manage game collections.  

GameVault allows users to manually add their games by entering key details such as the game’s name, platform, value, whether it is digital or physical, and a short description. Users can then view and browse their entire collection effortlessly.  

GameVault is aimed at gamers and collectors who want a convenient way to organize their game collection. They can be casual gamers looking for a way to track the games they own or dedicated collectors with a larger collection.
